# `ocrspace`

> A Python wrapper for using the [ocr.space API](https://ocr.space/ocrapi).

## Installation
Simply install from `pip`:
```sh
pip install ocrspace
```

## Use
First you'll need to import and instantiate the API wrapper:
```py
import ocrspace
api = ocrspace.API()
# Or if you have a custom API host, API key or desired language, pass those:
api = ocrspace.API(endpoint='https://example.host', api_key='Insert key here', language=ocrspace.Language.Croatian)
```
To perform recognition on an image hosted at some URL:
```py
api.ocr_url('URL of image goes here')
```
Or, if you have an image locally upon which to perform recognition:
```py
api.ocr_file('image.jpg')
# or:
api.ocr_file(open('image.jpg', 'rb'))  # or any other file pointer
```
That's it! Look at [`example.py`](example.py) for a demonstration.
